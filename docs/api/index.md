# API Reference

Use Carnet programmatically in your Node.js, Bun, or Deno applications.

## Getting Started

Choose your integration path:

### Using Framework Adapters

**For most users**, use our pre-built adapters with your preferred LLM SDK:

- **[Vercel AI SDK](/api/adapters)** - Powerful streaming, tool calling, and multi-model support
- **[OpenAI SDK](/api/adapters)** - Direct integration with OpenAI's function calling
- **[Anthropic SDK](/api/adapters)** - Full Claude tool use capability

Adapters reduce integration boilerplate from 75+ lines to just 3 lines with zero configuration.

### Using Manual API

For advanced use cases, interact directly with the Carnet API to:
- Build custom adapters
- Integrate with frameworks we don't support yet
- Implement specialized workflows
- Debug or understand Carnet internals
