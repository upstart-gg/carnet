# Image Search Tools

Tools for finding appropriate stock images from public databases for website design.

## Overview

Search for high-quality stock images when you need realistic photography for websites. Use for common scenes, people, products, and generic imagery.

## When to Search vs Generate

### Search Stock Images When:
- Need realistic photography
- Common scenes (offices, people, products)
- Quick results needed
- Generic imagery acceptable

### Generate Custom Images When:
- Need branded/unique imagery
- Specific vision stock can't match
- Consistent style across multiple images
- Conceptual or abstract imagery
- Main agent explicitly requests generation
