> A framework for building AI agents with Vercel AI SDK using markdown-based content management

**Carnet** (French for "notebook") is a production-ready framework for managing AI agent definitions, skills, toolsets, and tools through markdown files. Designed for **Vercel AI SDK**, it provides intelligent prompt generation and progressive skill loading to build scalable, context-aware AI agents.

## Workflow

1. **Write** agent, skill, toolset, and tool definitions in markdown files using simple frontmatter syntax.
2. **Build** your content with the `carnet build` CLI command to generate a validated manifest.
3. **Integrate** with Vercel AI SDK using Carnet's native `getSystemPrompt()` and `getTools()` methods.
