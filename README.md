# Carnet

> A build system and content management library for AI agents defined in markdown files

**Carnet** (French for "notebook") is a framework for managing AI agent definitions, skills, toolsets, and tools through markdown files. Define your agents declaratively, validate references at build time, and get optimized JSON manifests for runtime use.

## Workflow

1. **Write** agent, skill, toolset, and tool definitions in markdown files using simple frontmatter syntax.
2. **Build** your content with the `carnet build` CLI command to generate a validated manifest.
3. **Use** the Carnet library to to load prompts and tools for your agents in your application.
