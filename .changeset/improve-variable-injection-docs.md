Improve variable injection documentation and examples

Enhanced documentation for the variable injection feature with clearer examples demonstrating both static (constructor-level) and dynamic (method-level) variable usage patterns. Fixed incorrect API signatures and added comprehensive JSDoc examples showing how to use getSystemPrompt() with runtime variables for dynamic prompt adaptation.
